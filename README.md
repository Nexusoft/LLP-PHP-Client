# LLP-PHP-Client

Basic Php Classes and Utilities for Deserializing LLP Data from Server Backend. Functions to allow data transmission between web server and pool server.
This is baseline, more improvements to come.

Note: This is to be changed into JSON, as integer serialization is limited by PHP's 32 signed integer maximum.
This repository will be changed / possibly removed in the future to be replaced by the LLL as a function of the LLW component of the Library.
